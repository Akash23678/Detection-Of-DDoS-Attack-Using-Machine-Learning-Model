# Detection-Of-DDoS-Attack-Using-Machine-Learning-Model


## Overview

Here my objective is to develop a model that can accurately identify DDoS attacks in network traffic data. This will help the **organizations** detect and respond to DDoS attacks in a timely manner, protect their digital assets, prevent revenue loss and maintain their reputaion by detecting and mitigation DDoS attacks quickly and effectively. Furthermore, this model has the potential to improve internet access for **individuals** by reducing the impact of DDoS attacks on internet infrastructure and services.

## Tools and Technologies Used

#### Kali Linux
#### * hping3
#### Metasploitable 2
#### Wireshark
#### Google Colab IDE
#### Python, Pandas Lib
#### ML Algo:- SVM(Support Vector Machine)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of network traffic data captured during simulated DDoS attacks. The data was captured using Wireshark, a popular network protocol analyzer tool. The dataset contains various features such as packet size, protocol type, source and destination IP addresses, timestamp, zdestination port, Info.
